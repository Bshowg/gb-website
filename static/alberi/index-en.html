                    Roots is a photographic and research project dedicated to migrations: those silent and ancient journeys 
                    that tree species undertake crossing continents through phenomena such as wind, water, animals, and climate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal is to unite <strong>art and science</strong>, using photography to tell stories of movement,
                    adaptation, and connection, and to show how trees are witnesses to a migratory process 
                    that precedes and transcends human intervention.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are looking for institutions, researchers, and organizations willing to share knowledge, data, or
                    perspectives capable of enriching this journey. Even a minimal contribution can help build
                    a broader and more meaningful narrative.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project stems from the desire to investigate the natural and global spread of certain tree species,
                    linking the migrations of trees with those of human beings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This parallel aims to become a narrative thread capable of showing how roots and paths —
                    natural or human — are both expressions of the same impulse toward movement, exchange, and
                    transformation that runs through life on the planet.

    <!-- Critique of Finalism -->

                        The message we want to spread is a critique of finalism, but what is finalism? For Spinoza, it is a great misconception. 
                        That is, human beings are accustomed to thinking that everything that exists was created for a purpose, especially for our benefit.
                        We imagine a God who would have built the world just as a carpenter builds a chair:
                        with a precise purpose.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Since we almost always act with objectives: political, economic, military, social. We project this
                        logic onto the universe as well. From this comes the idea that everything, from animals to plants, is at the service
                        of man: a vision that runs through Bacon, Descartes, and much of our culture.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        But for Spinoza, this is not the case at all. When a man looks at a tree, he is not facing
                        an object created for him: he is in relation with another mode of the same substance.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The universe coincides with nature. What then is man's destiny? To know nature, that is,
                        to know God. To understand that everything that happens is part of a single infinite, necessary process, of
                        which we are also a small part.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Man is free only in one sense: he is free to understand necessity. Freedom does not consist in
                        being able to do anything, but in recognizing and accepting the way in which nature manifests itself. Things
                        happen because, in substance, they must happen. The substance lives, transforms itself,
                        expresses itself in infinite ways that correspond to each other. True freedom is understanding this necessity and
                        harmonizing with it.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p><b>
                        Nature has experimented with every possibility of movement, and we still discover new ones today. In
                        that infinite variety of gestures and ingenuity reveals the most ancient force of life: the drive to spread,
                        adapt, start again.
                        </b>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        We speak of migration only because we have created borders. Nature, on the other hand, recognizes none:
                        seeds, spores, and larvae cross oceans and continents without ever being "out of place."
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        If we look at this movement through Spinoza's eyes, for whom God and Nature are the same
                        thing, the contrast becomes even more evident.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="conclusion">
                        <strong>Nature does not distinguish, does not separate, does not judge: it expands, renews itself, moves. The borders we
                        have erected between us are then human constructions, fragile and often inconsistent, especially when
                        we compare them with the freedom of movement that belongs to the only divine reality that we all
                        share: Nature itself.</strong>
