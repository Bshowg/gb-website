    "title": "About Us",
    "description1": "Bizzosa is a love story. For the wind and the sea. A love that began in the 70s by a group of friends with the dream of sailing.",
    "description2": "From a self-produced prototype boat, today Bizzosa is a Grand Soleil 46.3 feet built by Cantiere Del Pardo. A boat with 25 years of competitive sailing history around the Mediterranean, from the Giraglia Rolex Cup, Les Voiles de Saint-Tropez, to the Barcolana, between offshore and inshore sailing.",
    "description3": "The first time I boarded Bizzosa I was 6 years old, I didn't understand anything about sailing, but I loved to breathe it. Today much of what I've understood is reflected in the respect I feel in my hands when the boat goes close-hauled with 20 knots of Libeccio and a tack needs to be called.",
    "description4": "I've understood that at sea life is slow but fast, that you learn every day if you accept change, that the wind speaks clearly if you know how to listen, and that you can dry it as much as you want, but there will always be some water in the bilge, but above all I've understood that if there are no problems to solve, you're probably standing still.",
