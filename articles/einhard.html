        <strong>Abstract</strong>
        <p>A groundbreaking discovery has revealed the hidden history of a daring but ill-fated relic 
            acquisition by Einhard, biographer of Charlemagne. He is known for orchestrating the theft of saintly 
            remains from Rome with success and great praise and envy from his peers</p>
        <p>
           However, recent archaeological and textual evidence has uncovered a shocking twist:
            Einhard set his sights on the Holy Land, dispatching emissaries to procure 
            sacred relics from way further then ever thought before. Emissaries were deceived by a <i>supposedly</i> Babylonian group of 
            self-defined wizards into stealing not a saint’s relic, but the preserved corpse of a figure the sect revered as a deity. This article analyzes 
            the newly unearthed documents and artifacts that brought this tale to light, shedding new light
             on medieval interactions between Christian relic veneration and Babylonian occult practices.

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>The theft of relics was a prominent feature of early medieval Christian expansion, often blurring the lines 
        between piety and subterfuge. Einhard’s success in acquiring saintly remains from Rome echoed through the newly formed Frankish Empire.
         This paper investigates the rediscovery of Einhard’s second and less celebrated mission, which,
          according to newly deciphered manuscripts, culminated in the later shadowed encounter with a Babylonian cult.
           This encounter reshaped not only the narrative of Einhard’s exploits but also medieval understandings 
           of sacred and profane boundaries.</p>
    <h2>2. Einhard’s Roman Exploits</h2>
    <p>Einhard’s Roman relic theft, well-documented and celebrated in contemporaneous accounts, involved the calculated 
        smuggling of a saint’s body from Rome to a Frankish monastery.
        In 826 AD Hilduin of Saint-Denis, archchaplain of Louis the Pious, was able to obtain the relics of
        Saint Sebastian. Einhard took the issue personally, given the rivalry at court between the two, and the following
        year he organized a mission to Rome to steal the relics of Marcellinus and Petrus Exorcista. He sent 
        his notary, Ratleig, to Rome to steal the saints' remains. Ratleig was able to obtain the relics and bring them north, 
        where they were received with great pomp in Michelstadt. The relics were then moved to Seligenstadt, near Frankfurt, where they remain to this day.

        However, from the accounts of Einhard is clean that it didn't go as planned. In fact he openly accused Hilduin
        of stealing parts of Saint Marcellinus. Hilduin's servant, Hunus, traveled with Ratleig to Rome and stole
        part of the saint's body for his master. Einhard was only able to reunite the two parts of the body one year later, in 828 AD,
        after Hilduin finally confessed. This episode was a great embarrassment for Einhard, who saw his victory overshadowed by the
        rival, since everyone was focusing on the scandal rather than the relic itself.

    <h2>3. The Rediscovery</h2>
    <p>
        Untill now, the records of the faida between Einhard and Hilduin ended with forced confession of the latter. 
        The current study stems from the recent identification of an overlooked X century codex in the monastic 
        archives of Fulda, Germany.The <i>Codex Fuldini</i>, written by anonymous, spans many subjects and at least one century, 
        with some text dated to the second half of the XI century. The authors' ortogonal approach on the matter 
        was instrumental in deciphering cryptic fragments in the codex, because the document bridged disparate cultural, linguistic,
         and historical contexts that required expertise from both fields. This cooperation brought to light that the marginalia in some pages
         where not just decorative, but were themself holding information. The side drawings and miniatures in the book 
         are more abundant than in any other codices of the same period. The authors were able to identify the drawings as
         a mimicry of cuneiform script. After further research a translation map was found in the codex, hidden in a historieted initial, where 
         all cuneiform symbols where matched with latin letters. This allowed the authors to translate parts of the
         codex that revealed the ill-fated mission of Einhard to the Holy Land. Given the content of the new text, it is clear that the
         who wrote it wanted to hide the infomation from orthodox eyes, since the story told could be easily interpreted as heresy.

    </p>
    <h2>4. Einhard's Second Mission</h2>
    <p>The Fulda codex reveal that in 829 AD Ratleig was ordered by Einhard to reached the Holy Land in the pursuit of a saintly relic that would dwarf the ones from Rome.
        Ratleig's party traveled by sea to the Levant, disguised as merchant, with a forged cargo of wood to sell in Jerusalem.
        The journey was perilous and they encountered a storm that forced them to land on the costs of todays Syria. The ship
        was damaged and needed repairs, so the party decided to travel to the nearest city to find materials. During the search
        they stumbled upon a village of exotic people. The villagers could speak latin, but were Infedels. 
        Their customs didn't match what was know of that heritic the inhabited those regions, but the knowlege at the time was scarce and generic.
        The codex describes many uses of these people, like their temple build in the shape of pyramid and a net tunnels carved in the stone beneath.The main chamber, full of statues of humans of different sizes with overexaggerated eyes, all watching the altar.
        And their daily offering of libations at sunset. The party was, nonetheless, welcomed by the villagers, who offered them food and shelter.
        The villagers were ruled by a council of elders, to whom the party was not allowed to speak. These men were called wizards by the people and they were the earthly emissaries of their god, a deity named <i class="name">Kingaludda</i>.
        Ratleig and some of his men were approached by one of the wizards, who offered them a gift, a relic of their god. 
        The wizard explained that they have had that relic for centuries, buried in the temple, and they never had the occasion
        to return it to its worshippers. The body was mummified and emanated a distinct perfume of spices. 
        The party was puzzled by the offer and diffident of the wizard, but in that moment arrived the news from the other part of the crew
        that the ship was miraculously repaired and ready to sail. Seeing the event as the will of God, Ratleig accepted the offer and 
        loaded the mummy on the ship and sailed back to Frankish territory. During the journey back half of the crew lost their life
        to a mysterious disease, but Ratleig and the mummy arrived safely in Europe.
        The council's motives remain speculative but likely involved using the emissary to rid themselves of a relic they deemed dangerous, or to spread it so it would infect others.</p>
    <h2>5. The Body’s Fate</h2>
    <p>Ratleig transported the corpse back to Seligenstadt in the firts months of 830 AD, where its arrival sparked 
        immediate controversy. Since the body left on the ship and the crew fall ill it started to exuded an unexplainable
        stench. The surviving crew members called the body cursed and even Ratleig refused to further interact with it.
        Einhard was informed of the situation and ordered the body to be carried to one of his monasteries outside of the city.
        The account of the <i>Codex Fuldini</i> ends here, so we don't know what has been of the body after.
        What we know is what happened to Hilduin after. Soon after the arrival of the body, a war broke
        out betweeen Emperor Louis and his sons, where Hilduin took the side the latters.
        The emperor won, thereby Hilduin lost his abbeys and was banished. Einhard, on the other hand, didn't took any side and misteriously retired from court.
        We don't have any informations about its life after the event, except is death, 10 years later, in 840 AD.
    </p>
    <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This rediscovery raises more questions than it answers. The culture of the village described in the <i>Codex Fuldini</i>
        has clearly many parallel with what we know of the Assirian and Babylonian culture, but is not well explained how this people
        could live for so many centuries in a bubble of time. The council of wizards, in particular, is a figure that is not present in any other
        known culture of the time. The body itself is a mistery, even if it was really a Christian relic, why would the villagers
        offer it to a group of strangers? And why would they offer it to a group of people that they knew were not of their faith? And if it wasn't 
        what was the purpose of the gift?  
        Also the Codex itself holds many question. Why was it written? Who wrote it? How was the writer able to know so much about the events?
        And why hide them in such an exotic way? There are many manuscripts the withold information to the reader, but none of them using cuneiform symbols.
        This brings us to the most important question? How would they know of the cuneiform script? It was only rediscovered in the XIX century, and the European
        world of the time had no way to know it. The <i>Codex Fuldini</i> is a mistery that will keep us busy for many years to come.
